Pai
=====================

Pai is a mobile application where we gamify friendship! You are randomly matched with users and provided "nuggets" of information about that person. You can use this information, and the location screen to eventually find your friend. To officially "friend" somebody, you must scan their QR code which will add a talley on your friends bagde. 

### Motivation

The word mamihlapinata<strong>PAI</strong>. It allegedly refers to "a look shared by two people, each wishing that the other would initiate something that they both desire but which neither wants to begin."

We took this opportunity to use tech to try and bring people together in reality instead of continuing the cycle of disconnect that can occur with social media.
